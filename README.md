# 🔌 Punjab Power Cut Tracker (PSPCL Web Interface)

A lightweight web app that shows **real-time power supply status** across Punjab, India — using PSPCL data.
Built to provide easy access to **district-wise, division-wise, and subdivision-wise power cut information** — **without needing the PSPCL mobile app**.

## 🔐 Token ID Requirement

The PSPCL API requires a valid `tokenId` to fetch data.
This token is generated by the official PSPCL mobile app and can be extracted by **intercepting network requests** using tools like **HTTP Toolkit** or similar network monitors.

> The backend uses this `tokenId` in its request headers to communicate with PSPCL’s API.

## 📦 How to Run Locally (once in repo directory)

### Backend (Flask)

```bash
cd flask-backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Frontend (React)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

> Make sure both frontend and backend are running properly. CORS is handled by routing requests through the backend.
